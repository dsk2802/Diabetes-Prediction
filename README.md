# Bike-rent prediction
The objective of the proposed work is to predict the bike rental count which is based on the
Seasonal settings like temperature, wind speed, humidity etc and also environmental settings.
The dataset provided has all together 16 variables (15 independent and 01 dependent) with 731 observations.
There is one categorical variable dteday and 15 numerical variables. Out of which one is target variable(cnt).

Steps involved 
1.Data Preprocessin: Missing value analysis
2.Outlier Analysis
3.Data Visualization
4.Feature selection using correlation analysis
5.Model Seleciton
6.Model Evaluation

For the above problem statement the model is built using regression.Both R and pyhton are used to implemnt the model
While building the model Linear regression and decision tree were applied.
